 * MIRROR OF viza-be/agent-backend/src/types/submission-result.ts.
 * Keep these two files byte-equivalent below the file-header comment.
 *
 * Discriminated by `country`. Status semantics:
 *   - submitted              terminal success (form fully submitted on portal)
 *   - stopped_at_sign        US: reached sign-and-submit gate, halted intentionally
 *   - stopped_at_pay         FR/UK/VN: reached payment gate, halted per policy
 *   - stopped_at_review      AU: form filled to the Review page; user must
 *                            log in to ImmiAccount and click Submit themselves
 *                            (legal requirement — VIZA cannot submit on the
 *                            user's behalf for Subclass 600).
 *   - submitted_pending_email VN: data captured, user must complete payment
 *                            externally; PDF arrives by email post-approval
 *   - registered             UK: account registered, application not yet started
 *   - appointment_held       FR: appointment slot tentatively held pre-payment
