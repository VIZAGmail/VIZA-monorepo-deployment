2. Creates service record with Shopify product/variant IDs in `plan_json`
3. Inserts item record (name, dosage, schedule, dates)
4. Revalidates user detail page
5. service appears in timeline (right-aligned)
6. **No Shopify order created yet** - awaits admin approval

**Admin Approval at End of Consultation** (`app/actions/consultations.ts`):

When admin clicks "End Consultation":
1. Dialog shows all pending services for the consultation
2. Admin reviews and clicks "Approve & End" or "Reject Order"
3. If approved: `createAndCompleteShopifyOrder()` creates actual Shopify order
4. Order moves to `status: open` and appears in Unfulfilled tab
5. Consultation ends with `status: completed`

**Shopify Order Creation** (`lib/order-utils.ts`):

- `createAndCompleteShopifyOrder()` - Creates draft order and completes it
- Customer linked via Shopify customer ID or email
- Includes `SKIP_SHOPIFY_API` flag for testing mode

### 6. Consultations (`/admin-v2/consultations`)

- Consultations list filtered by authenticated admin ID
- Color-coded status badges (Ready=green, In Progress=blue, Missed=red, etc.)
- Email displayed for user identification

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### Authentication System

**Login** (`/app/login/page.tsx`):

- Email/password authentication via Supabase
- Real authentication (no demo mode)
- Error handling and validation
- Loading states

**Server Actions** (`app/actions/auth.ts`):

- `signIn()`: Authenticates user, checks role, redirects appropriately
- `signOut()`: Clears session, redirects to login

**OAuth Callback** (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`):

- Handles authentication redirects
- Exchanges code for session
- Role-based redirection
- Production-ready with forwarded host support

### Role-Based Access Control

**Middleware** (`middleware.ts` + `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`):

- Protects all `/staff/*` and `/admin-v2/*` routes
- Fetches user role from `users` table
- **Auto-redirect on login**:
  - `role = 'admin'` → `/admin-v2`
  - `role = 'admin' | 'staff'` → `/staff`
- **Cross-access prevention**:
  - Admins cannot access `/staff/*`
  - Staff/admin cannot access `/admin-v2/*`

**Session Management**:

- Server components use `await createClient()`
- Client components use `createBrowserClient()`
- All admin pages fetch authenticated user ID
- Authorization checks with "Unauthorized" fallbacks

### User Impersonation (`/manage/impersonate`)

Allows authorized admins to view the client portal (`/client/*`) as any user for support and auditing.

**How it works**:
1. Admin searches for user, enters reason, clicks "View as User"
2. Server generates a signed token stored in `impersonation_tokens` table
3. New tab opens → callback validates token → sets `impersonation_session` cookie (JWT, 1hr, path: `/client`)
4. Client portal checks for impersonation cookie before Supabase session
5. Admin's Supabase session in `/manage` remains untouched (no session collision)

**Key Files**:
- `/app/manage/impersonate/page.tsx` - Impersonation UI
- `/app/auth/impersonate-callback/route.ts` - Token validation, cookie creation
- `/lib/impersonation-session.ts` - Cookie utilities (`createImpersonationCookie`, `getImpersonationSession`)
- `/app/actions/impersonation.ts` - Token generation, audit logging

**Impersonation-Aware Actions** (check impersonation cookie first):
- `/lib/auth/get-authenticated-user.ts` - Shared helper
- `/app/actions/client-lab-reports.ts` - Uses admin API endpoints for impersonation to bypass user role check
- `/app/actions/user-profile.ts`, `/app/actions/profile data.ts`, `/app/actions/action-plans.ts`

**Database Tables**: `impersonation_allowed_users`, `impersonation_tokens`, `impersonation_audit_log`

### Logout Functionality

**Both Portals**:

- Logout button in sidebar
- Loading states during logout
- Server action clears session
- Redirects to login page

## 🎨 Design System

### Brand Colors

- **Primary**: `#C2785F`
- **Variations**: 50-900 scale in `tailwind.config.ts`
- **Background**: White
- **Dark Mode**: Disabled (future enhancement)

### Typography

- **Font**: Sofia Pro (commercial font - files in `/public/fonts/`)
- **Fallback**: System fonts (currently active)
- **To enable**: Uncomment font config in `app/layout.tsx`

### UI Components (shadcn/ui)

- Button, Card, Table, Badge
- Input, Select, Tabs, Dialog
- Sheet (mobile menu), Scroll Area
- Skeleton, Dropdown, Separator
- Avatar, Textarea, Label, Form

### Currency Formatting

All currency displays use **Philippine Pesos (PHP)** with the `₱` symbol.

**Shared Utility** (`lib/utils.ts`):
```typescript
export function formatCurrency(amount: number): string {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat("en-PH", {
    style: "currency",
    currency: "PHP",
  }).format(amount);
}
```

**Usage**: Import `formatCurrency` from `@/lib/utils` in any component that needs to display monetary values.

**Files using currency formatting**:
- `components/dashboard-metrics.tsx` - Total revenue display
- `components/recent-orders-list.tsx` - Order totals
- `components/user-orders-list.tsx` - Order history
- `components/consultation-order-card.tsx` - Latest order card
- `components/order-details-modal.tsx` - Order details
- `components/shopify-customer-search.tsx` - Customer total spent
- `components/shopify-link-modal.tsx` - Linked customer info
- `components/service-item-modal.tsx` - Product prices
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Shopify customers table
- `app/staff/users/page.tsx` - Shopify customers table
- `app/staff/products/page.tsx` - Product prices
- `app/manage/products/page.tsx` - Product and variant prices + inventory

### Supabase Query Limits

**IMPORTANT:** Supabase's PostgREST API defaults to returning a maximum of **1,000 rows** per query. This affects any query that could return more than 1,000 records.

**When writing queries that may exceed 1,000 rows:**

1. **For counts:** Always use `{ count: "exact", head: true }` instead of fetching rows and using `.length`
   ```typescript
   // GOOD - Uses database COUNT
   const { count } = await adminClient
     .from("orders")
     .select("*", { count: "exact", head: true });

   // BAD - Capped at 1000
   const { data } = await adminClient.from("orders").select("*");
   const count = data?.length; // Max 1000!
   ```

2. **For aggregations (SUM, AVG):** Use database RPC functions
   ```typescript
   // GOOD - Single value from database
   const { data } = await (adminClient as any).rpc('get_order_revenue', { ... });

   // BAD - Fetches all rows, caps at 1000
   const { data } = await adminClient.from("orders").select("order_data");
   const total = data?.reduce(...); // Missing data!
   ```

3. **For listing data:** Use `.range()` pagination
   ```typescript
   // GOOD - Explicit pagination
   const { data } = await adminClient
     .from("orders")
     .select("*")
     .range(0, 99); // Page 1
   ```

**Database RPC functions available:**
- `get_order_revenue(start_date, end_date)` - Sum of order totals
- `get_consultation_status_counts(start_date, end_date, admin_filter)` - Consultation status breakdown
- `get_service_approval_counts(start_date, end_date, admin_filter)` - Treatment approval breakdown

**Files with pagination/RPC implemented:**
- `app/actions/dashboard.ts` - Uses RPC for revenue, count for orders
- `app/actions/reports.ts` - Uses RPC functions for consultation and service metrics
- `app/actions/consultations.ts` - Uses date windowing + pagination
- `app/staff/users/page.tsx` - Uses pagination for user list

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Server Components (SSR)

- Admin-v2 home
- Admin-v2 user detail
- Staff users list
- Staff user detail
- Staff users management

**Pattern:**

```typescript
const supabase = await createClient();
const { data } = await supabase.from("table").select("*");
```

### Client Components (CSR)

- Admin-v2 consultations
- Staff consultations calendar
- Staff orders
- Login form
- Timeline add note form
- service modal

**Pattern:**

```typescript
const supabase = createBrowserClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);
```

### Shopify Integration (Hybrid Approach)

**Webhooks** → Sync to Supabase:

1. Order created/updated in Shopify
2. Webhook fires to `/api/shopify/webhooks/orders`
3. Signature verified
4. Order synced to `orders` table
5. User auto-linked by email match
6. Shopify customer ID saved

**On-Demand** → Real-time queries:

- Click "View Details" → Fetch from Shopify API
- Always current data
- No rate limit concerns for viewing

### User-Order Linking

- **Automatic**: Email matching in webhook handler
- **Manual**: Override in user details (UI placeholder)

---

## 📊 Authentication Flow

### Login Flow

1. User visits `/` or `/login`
2. Enters email/password in `LoginForm`
3. Server action `signIn()` authenticates with Supabase
4. Middleware checks user role from `users` table
5. Redirects based on role:
   - `role = 'admin'` → `/admin-v2`
   - `role = 'admin' | 'staff'` → `/staff`

### Route Protection

- Unauthenticated users cannot access `/staff/*` or `/admin-v2/*`
- Admins cannot access `/staff/*`
- Staff/admin cannot access `/admin-v2/*`
- All enforced in middleware

### Logout Flow

1. User clicks "Logout" button in sidebar
2. Client component calls `signOut()` server action
3. Server clears Supabase session
4. Redirects to `/login`

---

## 🏥 service Workflow

### Admin Side

1. Opens user detail (`/admin-v2/users/[id]`)
2. Clicks "service document" button
3. Fills form: item name, dosage, schedule, dates, notes
4. Submits → Server action creates:
   - Treatment record
   - document record with details
   - Order record with `RX-{timestamp}` ID
5. Page refreshes, service appears in timeline

### Staff Side

1. Opens orders tab (`/staff/orders`)
2. Sees new order with "service" badge
3. Can view details, process order
4. Order has user linked automatically

---

## 📝 Logging Standards

### Webhook Logging

All webhook handlers use structured JSON logging via `/lib/webhook-logger.ts` for Cloud Logging compatibility.

**Log Format:**
```typescript
{
  level: "info" | "warn" | "error",
  service: "webhook",
  provider: "shopify" | "calcom",
  event: "orders/create" | "BOOKING_CREATED" | etc,
  status: "received" | "processing" | "success" | "failed",
  resourceId: "12345",
  resourceType: "order" | "customer" | "booking" | etc,
  metadata: { ... },  // Optional: key business fields (NO PII)
  error: "message",   // Only on failures
  timestamp: "ISO8601"
}
```

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { logWebhook, getSafeErrorMessage } from "@/lib/webhook-logger";

// Log webhook received
logWebhook({
  level: "info",
  provider: "shopify",
  event: "orders/create",
  status: "received",
  resourceId: orderId,
  resourceType: "order",
  metadata: { financial_status: "paid" }
});

// Log errors safely
logWebhook({
  level: "error",
  provider: "shopify",
  event: "orders/create",
  status: "failed",
  resourceId: orderId,
  resourceType: "order",
  error: getSafeErrorMessage(error)
});
```

**What to Log:**
| Event Type | Fields to Include |
|------------|-------------------|
| Orders | order_id, status, financial_status, fulfillment_status |
| Customers | customer_id, event_type |
| Inventory | inventory_item_id, location_id, available_qty |
| Products | product_id, title, status |
| Fulfillments | fulfillment_id, order_id, status |
| Draft Orders | draft_order_id, name, status |
| Cal.com Bookings | booking_uid, event_type, consultation_id |

**What NOT to Log (Privacy/Security):**
- Email addresses (PII)
- Phone numbers (PII)
- Full names (PII)
- Webhook secrets or HMAC values
- Full request/response payloads
- Stack traces (use `getSafeErrorMessage()` instead)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Rebuild
npm run build
```

### Authentication Issues

- Check environment variables are set
- Verify user exists in `auth.users` and `public.users`
- Ensure role is set correctly in `users` table
- Check middleware is enabled

### Cannot Access Routes

- Ensure authenticated with valid session
- Check user role matches route access
- Verify middleware routing logic

### Docker Build Issues

- Ensure `output: "standalone"` in `next.config.ts`
- Check Dockerfile syntax

## 💰 Payments

Checkout paths converge on the same `order` table. Each one is either an
**authenticated** purchase (visitor already in `/client/*`) or a
**guest** marketing-funnel purchase (visitor pays first, then gets a
magic-link sign-in email). The `order.guest_checkout` boolean
(migration `0088_order_guest_checkout.sql`) records which: it is the
guard that decides whether `provisionAccountAndMagicLink` mails a login
link. Guest rails set it `true`; authenticated rails leave it `false`.

### Guest post-paid side-effects (shared)
- `lib/checkout/post-paid.ts` → `runPostPaidSideEffects(orderId, provider)`:
  fire-and-forget `provisionAccountAndMagicLink` (account + magic-link
  mail, self-guarded on `guest_checkout`) + `enqueueRunnerJob`. Used by
  both guest rails below.
- Magic-link mail: `lib/notify/templates.ts` `paid_welcome` (en + zh-CN;
  `wechat_paid_welcome` kept as an alias), sent via `lib/email/resend.ts`.
  From address overridable via `NOTIFY_FROM_EMAIL`.

### Stripe Checkout — authenticated (default)
- Server action: `app/actions/payments.ts` → `startCheckoutForApplication(applicationId)`
- Webhook: `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` (payment_records model).
- Authenticated only (the visitor is already in `/client/*`); `guest_checkout=false`.

### Guest card checkout — Stripe, unauthenticated
- **Pre-payment, unauthenticated.** Marketing CTAs deep-link to `/checkout/card?country=&visa=&locale=`. Visitor enters email + name; we upsert `applicant_profiles`, draft an `applications` row, and create a `pending` `order` with `guest_checkout=true`.
- Server action: `app/actions/card-checkout.ts` → `startCardCheckout({country, visaType, email, fullName, locale})` — mints a Stripe Checkout session via `lib/stripe/client.ts` with `metadata.order_id` + `metadata.guest_checkout=1`.
- Checkout UI: `app/checkout/card/page.tsx` + `_components/card-checkout-form.tsx`; success → `app/checkout/card/check-your-email`.
- Webhook: the **guest branch** of `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` (`handleGuestCheckoutSession`) routes guest sessions to the order-model `lib/stripe/handle-event.ts#applyStripeEvent` + `runPostPaidSideEffects(orderId, "card")`, bypassing the authenticated payment_records path.
- Pricing: `lib/pricing.ts#pricingFor` — agency fee + (passthrough govt fee).

### WeChat Pay Native v3 (direct-to-merchant) — unauthenticated
- **Pre-payment, unauthenticated.** Marketing site CTAs deep-link to `/checkout/wechat?country=&visa=&locale=`. Visitor enters email + name; we upsert `applicant_profiles`, draft an `applications` row, and create a `pending` `order` priced in CNY/fen with `guest_checkout=true`.
- SDK wrapper: `lib/wechatpay/client.ts` — RSA-SHA256 request signing, callback signature verification, AES-256-GCM resource decryption, platform-cert auto-fetch + cache. No npm SDK — just `node:crypto` + `fetch`, mirroring `lib/stripe/client.ts`.
- Event applier: `lib/wechatpay/handle-event.ts` (idempotent on `wechat_out_trade_no`).
- Server action: `app/actions/wechat-checkout.ts` → `startWechatCheckout({country, visaType, email, fullName, locale})`.
- Checkout UI: `app/checkout/wechat/page.tsx` + `_components/wechat-checkout-form.tsx` (renders a QR generated server-side via `qrcode` and polls `/api/wechat-pay/status/[orderId]`).
- Webhook: `app/api/wechat-pay/notify/route.ts` — on `kind === "paid"` calls the shared `runPostPaidSideEffects(orderId, "wechat")`. Responds `{code:"SUCCESS"}` per WeChat Pay spec.
- Pricing: `lib/pricing.ts` — packages opt in by setting `wechatPayTotalFen`; lookup via `wechatPricingFor()`. Phase 1 only `indonesia/B211A` is enabled.
- DB: migration `viza-be/agent-backend/drizzle/0086_wechat_pay.sql` adds `wechat_out_trade_no`, `wechat_prepay_id`, `wechat_transaction_id`, `wechat_payer_openid` to `order`.
- Env vars: `WECHAT_PAY_MCH_ID`, `WECHAT_PAY_APP_ID`, `WECHAT_PAY_API_V3_KEY`, `WECHAT_PAY_MERCHANT_SERIAL_NO`, `WECHAT_PAY_PRIVATE_KEY`, `WECHAT_PAY_NOTIFY_URL`, optional `WECHAT_PAY_PLATFORM_CERT_CACHE_TTL_S` (default 3600s).
